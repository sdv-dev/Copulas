# Overview

Copulas is a python library for building multivariate distributuions using
[copulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_%28probability_theory%29) and using them
for sampling. In short, you give a table of numerical data without missing values as a
2-dimensional `numpy.ndarray` and copulas models its distribution and using it to generate
new records, or analyze its statistical properties.

This repository contains multiple implementations of bivariate and multivariate copulas,
further functionality include:

* Most usual statistical functions from the underlying distribution.
* Built-in inverse-transform sampling method.
* Easy save and load of models.
* Create copulas directly from their parameters.

# Install

## Requirements

**Copulas** has been developed and tested on [Python 3.5, and 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Also, although it is not strictly required, the usage of a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
is highly recommended in order to avoid interfering with other software installed in the system where **Copulas**
is run.

These are the minimum commands needed to create a virtualenv using python3.6 for **Copulas**:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p $(which python3.6) copulas-venv
```

Afterwards, you have to execute this command to have the virtualenv activated:

```bash
source copulas-venv/bin/activate
```

Remember about executing it every time you start a new console to work on **Copulas**!


## Install with pip

After creating the virtualenv and activating it, we recommend using
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) in order to install **Copulas**:

```bash
pip install copulas
```

This will pull and install the latest stable release from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/).

## Install from source

Alternatively, with your virtualenv activated, you can clone the repository and install it from
source by running `make install` on the `stable` branch:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sdv-dev/Copulas.git
cd Copulas
git checkout stable
make install
```

## Install for Development

If you want to contribute to the project, a few more steps are required to make the project ready
for development.

First, please head to [the GitHub page of the project](https://github.com/sdv-dev/Copulas)
and make a fork of the project under you own username by clicking on the **fork** button on the
upper right corner of the page.

Afterwards, clone your fork and create a branch from master with a descriptive name that includes
the number of the issue that you are going to work on:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:{your username}/Copulas.git
cd Copulas
git branch issue-xx-cool-new-feature master
git checkout issue-xx-cool-new-feature
```

Finally, install the project with the following command, which will install some additional
dependencies for code linting and testing.

```bash
make install-develop
```

Make sure to use them regularly while developing by running the commands `make lint` and
`make test`.


# Concepts

## Probability

We call **probability** `P` to the measure assigned to the chance of an event happening.
For example, in a dice, there are 6 sides, each with the same chance of being on top.

If we consider `0` to be **impossible** and `1` **absolute certain**, we can explain
its probability like this:

```text
Table of values for probability P

 ·    -> 1/6
 :    -> 1/6
 :·   -> 1/6
 ::   -> 1/6
 :·:  -> 1/6
 :::  -> 1/6
```

## Random variable

A **random variable** `X` is a function mapping elements from the sample space
(in our case, the dice sides) into ℝ.

In our case we have:

```text
Table of values for random variable X and their probability P
      X       P
 ·    ->   1  ->  1/6
 :    ->   2  ->  1/6
 :·   ->   3  ->  1/6
 ::   ->   4  ->  1/6
 :·:  ->   5  ->  1/6
 :::  ->   6  ->  1/6
```

## Distribution

A **distribution** is a function that describes the behavior of a **random variable**,
like rolling a dice, and the probability of events related to them.

Usually a distribution is presented as a function F: ℝ -> [0, 1], called the
**cumulative distribution function** or **cdf**, that has the following properties:

* Is strictly **non-decreasing**
* Is **right-continous**
* It's limit to negative infinity exists and is 0.
* It's limit to positive infinite exists and is 1.

Below we can see the cdf of the distribution of rolling a standard, 6 sided, dice:

<img src="docs/images/dice_cdf.png" alt="CDF function of a dice"/>

We can see as the cumulative probability raises by steps of 1/6 at each integer between 1 and 6,
as those are the only values that can appear.

## Types of distributions

There are as many different distributions as different random phenomenon, but usually we classify
them using this three aspects:

* Continuity: We call a random variable a **continous random variable** if it's `cdf` is
  continuous, that it have no steps. Otherwise, we call it **discrete random variable**.
  In the example of the dice, we have discrete random variable.
* Dimensionality: When a random variable represents the behavior of a single random phenomenon,
  we call it a **univariate distribution**, analogously we define **bivariate** and
  **multivariate** distributions.
* Type: Most distribution have a type, defined by its behavior, some of the most common types of
  distributions are: **uniform**, **gaussian**, **exponential**,...

## Copulas

Copulas are multivariate distributions whose marginals are uniform. Using them with distributions
to model the marginals they allow us to generate **multivariate random variables** for any kind
of phenomena.

# Quickstart

In this short tutorial we will guide you through the a series of steps that will help you getting
started with the most basic usage of **Copulas** in order to generate samples from a simple
dataset.

**NOTE:** To be able to run this demo you will need to install the package from its sources.

## 1. Load the data

The first step is to load the data we will use to fit **Copulas**. In order to do so, we will
first import the module `pandas` and call its function `read_csv` with the path to our
example dataset.

In this case, we will load the `iris` dataset into a `pandas.DataFrame`.

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('data/iris.data.csv')
```

This will be return us a dataframe with 4 columns:

```
              0    1    2
feature_01  5.1  4.9  4.7
feature_02  3.5  3.0  3.2
feature_03  1.4  1.4  1.3
feature_04  0.2  0.2  0.2
```

## 2. Create a Copula instance

The next step is to import Copulas and create an instance of the desired copulas.

To do so, we need to import the `copulas.multivariate.GaussianMultivariate` and call it, in order
to create a GaussianMultivariate instance with the default arguments:

```python
from copulas.multivariate import GaussianMultivariate
copula = GaussianMultivariate()
```

## 3. Fit the model

Once we have a **Copulas** instance, we can proceed to call its `fit` method passing the `data`
that we loaded bfore in order to start the fitting process:

```python
copula.fit(data)
```

## 4. Sample new data

After the model has been fitted, we are ready to generate new samples by calling the `sample`
method of the `Copulas` instance passing it the desired amount of samples:

```python
num_samples = 1000
samples = copula.sample(num_samples)
```

This will return a DataFrame with the same number of columns as the original data.

```
                   0         1         2
feature_01  7.534814  7.255292  5.723322
feature_02  2.723615  2.959855  3.282245
feature_03  6.465199  6.896618  2.658393
feature_04  2.267646  2.442479  1.109811
```

The returned object, `samples`, is a `pandas.DataFrame` containing a table of synthetic data with
the same format as the input data and 1000 rows as we requested.

## 5. Load and save a model

For some copula models the fitting process can take a lot of time, so we probably would like to
avoid having to fit every we want to generate samples. Instead we can fit a model once, save it,
and load it every time we want to sample new data.

If we have a fitted model, we can save it by calling it's `save` method, that only takes
as argument the path where the model will be stored. Similarly, the `load` allows to load
a model stored on disk by passing as argument the path where the model is stored.

```python
model_path = 'mymodel.pkl'
copula.save(model_path)
```

Once the model is saved, it can be loaded back as a **Copulas** instance by using the `load`
method:

**NOTE**: In order to load a saved model, you need to load it using the same class that was used to save it.

```python
new_copula = GaussianMultivariate.load(model_path)
```

At this point we could use this model instance to generate more samples.

```python
new_samples = new_copula.sample(num_samples)
```

## 6. Extract and set parameters

In some cases it's more useful to obtain the parameters from a fitted copula than to save
and load from disk.

Once our copula is fitted, we can extract it's parameters using the `to_dict` method:

```python
copula_params = copula.to_dict()
```

This will return a dictionary containing all the copula parameters:

```
{'covariance': [[1.006711409395973,
   -0.11010327176239859,
   0.877604856347186,
   0.8234432550696282],
  [-0.11010327176239859,
   1.006711409395972,
   -0.4233383520816992,
   -0.3589370029669185],
  [0.877604856347186,
   -0.4233383520816992,
   1.006711409395973,
   0.9692185540781538],
  [0.8234432550696282,
   -0.3589370029669185,
   0.9692185540781538,
   1.006711409395974]],
 'distribs': {'feature_01': {'type': 'copulas.univariate.gaussian.GaussianUnivariate',
   'fitted': True,
   'constant_value': None,
   'mean': 5.843333333333334,
   'std': 0.8253012917851409},
  'feature_02': {'type': 'copulas.univariate.gaussian.GaussianUnivariate',
   'fitted': True,
   'constant_value': None,
   'mean': 3.0540000000000003,
   'std': 0.4321465800705435},
  'feature_03': {'type': 'copulas.univariate.gaussian.GaussianUnivariate',
   'fitted': True,
   'constant_value': None,
   'mean': 3.758666666666666,
   'std': 1.7585291834055212},
  'feature_04': {'type': 'copulas.univariate.gaussian.GaussianUnivariate',
   'fitted': True,
   'constant_value': None,
   'mean': 1.1986666666666668,
   'std': 0.7606126185881716}},
 'type': 'copulas.multivariate.gaussian.GaussianMultivariate',
 'fitted': True,
 'distribution': 'copulas.univariate.gaussian.GaussianUnivariate'}
```

Once we have all the parameters we can create a new identical **Copula** instance by using the method `from_dict`:

```python
new_copula = GaussianMultivariate.from_dict(copula_params)
```

At this point we could use this model instance to generate more samples.

```python
new_samples = new_copula.sample(num_samples)
```
