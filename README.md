# Overview

**Copulas** is a Python library for modeling multivariate distributions and sampling from them
using [copula functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_%28probability_theory%29).
Given a table containing numerical data, we can use Copulas to learn the distribution and
generate new synthetic data following the same statistical properties.

# Features

The Copulas library includes a variety of features for modeling multivariate data and using it to sample synthetic data. Key features include:

* **Modeling univariate, bivariate and multivariate data.** Choose from a variety of univariate
distributions and copulas â€“ including Archimedian Copulas, Gaussian Copulas and Vine Copulas.
The library includes tools to automatically select the best distribution for accurate modeling.

* **Comparing real and synthetic data visually** after building your model. Visualizations
are available as 1D histograms, 2D scatterplots and 3D scatterplots.

* **Accessing & manipulating learned parameters.** With complete access to the internals
of the model, advanced users can set or tune parameters to their choosing.

## Supported Distributions
| Distribution Type          | Supported Distributions                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Univariate Distributions   | Beta, Gamma, Gaussian, Gaussian KDE, Log-Laplace, Student T, Truncated Gaussian, Uniform |
| Bivariate Distributions    | Archimedian Copulas: Clayton, Frank, Gumbel                                              |
| Multivariate Distributions | Gaussian Copula, Vine Copulas: D-Vine, C-Vine, R-Vine                                    |
# Install

Install Copulas to use as a standalone library:

**Using `pip`:**

```bash
pip install copulas
```

**Using `conda`:**

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge copulas
```

For more installation options please visit the [Copulas installation Guide](INSTALL.md)

:warning: If you'd like to create synthetic data end-to-end, we recommend getting started with
the **SDV library** which provides user-friendly APIs for Copulas modeling. :warning:

The SDV library provides wrappers for preprocessing your data as well as additional usability features like constraints. See the [SDV documentation](https://bit.ly/sdv-docs) to get started.

# Usage

In this example, we'll load a dataset with 3 columns and model it using a multivariate,
Gaussian Copula.

```python3
from copulas.datasets import sample_trivariate_xyz
from copulas.multivariate import GaussianMultivariate
from copulas.visualization import compare_3d

# Load a dataset with 3 columns
real_data = sample_trivariate_xyz()

# Fit a gaussian copula to the data
copula = GaussianMultivariate()
copula.fit(real_data)

# Sample synthetic data
synthetic_data = copula.sample(len(real_data))

# Plot the real and the synthetic data to compare
compare_3d(real_data, synthetic_data)
```

The output will be a figure with two plots, showing both the real and the synthetic side-by-side.

[The Synthetic Data Vault Project](https://sdv.dev) was first created at MIT's [Data to AI Lab](
https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) in 2016. After 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, we
created [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.
Today, DataCebo is the proud developer of SDV, the largest ecosystem for
synthetic data generation & evaluation. It is home to multiple libraries that support synthetic
data, including:

* ðŸ”„ Data discovery & transformation. Reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.
* ðŸ§  Multiple machine learning models -- ranging from Copulas to Deep Learning -- to create tabular,
  multi table and time series data.
* ðŸ“Š Measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data
  generation models.

[Get started using the SDV package](https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/install.html) -- a fully
integrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data. Or, use the standalone libraries
for specific needs.
