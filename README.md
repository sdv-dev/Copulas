# Overview

**Copulas** is a Python library for modeling multivariate distributions and sampling from them
using [copula functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_%28probability_theory%29).
Given a table containing numerical data, we can use Copulas to learn the distribution and
later on generate new synthetic rows following the same statistical properties.

# Install

**Copulas** is part of the **SDV** project and is automatically installed alongside it. For
details about this process please visit the [SDV Installation Guide](
https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/install.html)

Optionally, **Copulas** can also be installed as a standalone library using the following commands:

**Using `pip`:**

```bash
pip install copulas
```

**Using `conda`:**

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge copulas
```

For more installation options please visit the [Copulas installation Guide](INSTALL.md)

# Quickstart

In this short quickstart, we show how to model a multivariate dataset and then generate
synthetic data that resembles it.

```python3
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

from copulas.datasets import sample_trivariate_xyz
from copulas.multivariate import GaussianMultivariate
from copulas.visualization import compare_3d

# Load a dataset with 3 columns that are not independent
real_data = sample_trivariate_xyz()

# Fit a gaussian copula to the data
copula = GaussianMultivariate()
copula.fit(real_data)

# Sample synthetic data
synthetic_data = copula.sample(len(real_data))

# Plot the real and the synthetic data to compare
compare_3d(real_data, synthetic_data)
```

The output will be a figure with two plots, showing what both the real and the synthetic
data that you just generated look like:

[The Synthetic Data Vault Project](https://sdv.dev) was first created at MIT's [Data to AI Lab](
https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) in 2016. After 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, we
created [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.
Today, DataCebo is the proud developer of SDV, the largest ecosystem for
synthetic data generation & evaluation. It is home to multiple libraries that support synthetic
data, including:

* ðŸ”„ Data discovery & transformation. Reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.
* ðŸ§  Multiple machine learning models -- ranging from Copulas to Deep Learning -- to create tabular,
  multi table and time series data.
* ðŸ“Š Measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data
  generation models.

[Get started using the SDV package](https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/install.html) -- a fully
integrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data. Or, use the standalone libraries
for specific needs.
