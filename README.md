# Overview

**Copulas** is a Python library for modeling multivariate distributions and sampling from them
using copula functions.
Given a table of numerical data, use Copulas to learn the distribution and
generate new synthetic data following the same statistical properties.

**Key Features:**

* **Model multivariate data.** Choose from a variety of univariate
distributions and copulas â€“ including Archimedian Copulas, Gaussian Copulas and Vine Copulas.

* **Compare real and synthetic data visually** after building your model. Visualizations
are available as 1D histograms, 2D scatterplots and 3D scatterplots.

* **Access & manipulate learned parameters.** With complete access to the internals
of the model, set or tune parameters to your choosing.

# Install

Install the Copulas library using pip or conda.

```bash
pip install copulas
```

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge copulas
```

# Usage

Get started using a demo dataset. This dataset contains 3 numerical columns.

```python
from copulas.datasets import sample_trivariate_xyz

real_data = sample_trivariate_xyz()
real_data.head()
```

<img src="docs/images/copulas_sample_dataset.png" width="300">

Model the data using a copula and use it to create synthetic data.
The Copulas library offers many options including Gaussian Copula,
Vine Copulas and Archimedian Copulas.

```python
from copulas.multivariate import GaussianMultivariate

copula = GaussianMultivariate()
copula.fit(real_data)

synthetic_data = copula.sample(len(real_data))
```

Visualize the real and synthetic data side-by-side. Let's do this in 3D so see our full dataset.

```python
from copulas.visualization import compare_3d

compare_3d(real_data, synthetic_data)
```

[The Synthetic Data Vault Project](https://sdv.dev) was first created at MIT's [Data to AI Lab](
https://dai.lids.mit.edu/) in 2016. After 4 years of research and traction with enterprise, we
created [DataCebo](https://datacebo.com) in 2020 with the goal of growing the project.
Today, DataCebo is the proud developer of SDV, the largest ecosystem for
synthetic data generation & evaluation. It is home to multiple libraries that support synthetic
data, including:

* ðŸ”„ Data discovery & transformation. Reverse the transforms to reproduce realistic data.
* ðŸ§  Multiple machine learning models -- ranging from Copulas to Deep Learning -- to create tabular,
  multi table and time series data.
* ðŸ“Š Measuring quality and privacy of synthetic data, and comparing different synthetic data
  generation models.

[Get started using the SDV package](https://sdv.dev/SDV/getting_started/install.html) -- a fully
integrated solution and your one-stop shop for synthetic data. Or, use the standalone libraries
for specific needs.
